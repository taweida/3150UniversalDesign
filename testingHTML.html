    <h1>Race cars!</h1>
    <p>
        I really enjoy <strong>automobiles</strong>. I have since I was a kid, and now I've grown up to be able to work on cars, and race them as well.

        I've gotten the opportunity to compete in the 100th running of the 
        <a href="https://www.ppihc.org/" title="ppihcHomePage" target="_blank">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a>, and I'm extremely excited.

        My family's home, including three race cars, burned down in the Marshall Fire in December. Very sad. 
        But my new racecar looks like this, and believe me, we have a <strong>long way to go</strong> before she is ready for The Hill!
