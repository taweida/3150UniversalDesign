    <p>Here is a link to my <em><a href="https://www.bringatrailer.com/" title="BaT" target="_blank">favorite website</a></em></p>

    <h1>Race cars!</h1>
    <p>I really enjoy <strong>automobiles</strong>. I have since I was a kid, and now I've grown up to be able to work on cars, and race them as well. 
    I've gotten the opportunity to compete in the 100th running of the 
    <a href="https://www.ppihc.org/" title="ppihcHomePage" target="_blank">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a>, and I'm extremely excited. 
    My dad and I had three racecars that burned down in the Marshall Fire in December. Very sad. 
    But my current racecar looks like this, and believe me we have a long way to go before she is ready for The Hill!
