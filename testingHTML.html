        Here is a link to my 
        <em>
            <a href="https://www.bringatrailer.com/" title="Bring-A-Trailer" target="_blank" style="color: #DD571C;">favorite website.</a>

        I really enjoy <strong>automobiles</strong>. I have since I was a kid, and now I've grown up to be able to work on cars, and race them as well.<br>
        In June I'll be competing in the 100th running of the 
        <em><a href="https://www.ppihc.org/" title="ppihc Home Page" target="_blank" style="color: #DD571C;">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a></em> for the second time, and I'm extremely excited. <br><br> 
        My family's home, including five classic cars, three race cars and four motorcycles, burned down in the Marshall Fire in December. <strong>Very sad</strong>.<br>
        But my <I>replacement</I> racecar looks like this, and believe me, we have a <strong>long way to go</strong> before she is ready for The Hill!<br>

        Assignment #6 Feedback
    </h1>
    <p>
        I didn't struggle too bad with this assignment. I was confused for a while on what specifically we were supposed to do. But clearly, I figured it out.<br>
        I've used HTML before, and I really enjoy it so I'm looking forward to fun things we get to do! <br>
        I have to make a website for another class as well, so working in parallel should help me be efficient in both classes. <br>
        I'm looking forward to messing around with more formatting in CSS because that's probably my weakest point, and it's very important to understand in this line of work.

        Assignment #7
    </h1>
    <p>
        Please let me know if what I did above doesn't <em>qualify</em> for assignment #7. Once I got started with assignment #6
        I got carried away, because I think HTML is fun. <br>
        Once I read assignment #7, I realized that it was essentially CSS practice, so I'm hoping what I did here for assignment #6 counts towards that.<br>
        If it doesn't, please let me know ASAP so I can complete assignment #7 as you Professor, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Test_your_skills:_HTML_text_basics" title="mdn HTML Basics" target="_blank" style="color: #3B3131;">MDN</a> have it written.
