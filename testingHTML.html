        <strong>Assignment #6</strong>

    <p>Here is a link to my

    <h1>Race cars!</h1>
    <p>
        I really enjoy <strong>automobiles</strong>. I have since I was a kid, and now I've grown up to be able to work on cars, and race them as well.<br>
        I've gotten the opportunity to compete by second year in the 100th running of the 
        <a href="https://www.ppihc.org/" title="ppihcHomePage" target="_blank">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a> in June, and I'm extremely excited. <br> 
        My family's home, including three race cars, burned down in the Marshall Fire in December. <strong>Very sad</strong>.<br>
        But my new racecar looks like this, and believe me, we have a <strong>long way to go</strong> before she is ready for The Hill!<br>

            Assignment Feedback

        I didn't struggle too bad with this assignment. I was confused for a while on what specifically we were supposed to do. But clearly, I figured it out.<br>
        I've used HTML before, and I really enjoy it so I'm looking forward to fun things we get to do! <br>
        I have to make a website for another class as well, so working in parallel should help me be efficient in both classes. <br>
        I'm looking forward to messing around with more formatting in CSS because that's probably my weakest point, and it's very important to understand in this line of work.
